      "C. <SecurityDeposit>$788</SecurityDeposit>, which sum shall be held by Landlord, without obligation for interest, as security for the performance of Tenant’s covenants and obligation under this Lease, it being expressly understood and agreed that such deposit is not an advance rental deposit, not the last month’s rent nor a measure of Landlord’s damages in the event of Tenant’s default. Upon the occurrence of any event of default by Tenant, Landlord may, <Frequency>from time to time</Frequency>, without prejudices to any other remedy provided herein or provided by law, use such deposit to the extent necessary to make good any arrears of rent of other payments due Landlord hereunder, and any other damage, injury, expense or liability caused by such event of default; or to perform any obligation required of Tenant under the Lease; and Tenant shall pay Landlord on demand the amount so applied in order to restore the security deposit to its original amount. Although the security deposit shall be deemed the property of Landlord, any remaining balance of such deposit shall be returned by Landlord to Tenant at such time after termination of this Lease that all of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease have been fulfilled.\n"
